# Python & Django Coding Rules

## Architecture & Structure
- **Service Layers**: Use service layers for all logic.
    - **Data Services**: IO layer over models. Should follow a mental model/needs-based approach, not model structure.
    - **Logic Services**: Handle all mutations and side effects.
- **Django Models**: 
    - Keep models "thin". Logic belongs in services.
    - **Factories**: Every model MUST have a corresponding `factory_boy` factory. 
        - Factories must provide options (traits or sub-factories) to generate a good spread of all possible model states and configurations.
- **Imports**: 
    - Prefer global imports over local ones (except to avoid specific circular dependencies).
    - Never import models except in data services or tests.
- **Decoupling**: Minimize dependencies and coupling. Wrap side-effect libraries in service layers to limit blast area.
- **Module Scope**: Only use `_` prefix for functions scoped to the current module. Never import `_` functions from elsewhere.

## Logic & Flow
- **Style**: 
    - Prefer guard clauses over if/else (minimize indentation).
    - Prefer small functions over multi-concern loops.
    - Always use keyword arguments (`kwargs`) when calling functions.
- **Data Handling**: 
    - Use **Data Classes** instead of raw dicts/lists for passing data.
    - Use **Constants** for any string referenced in more than one place. Collate constants.
- **Error Handling**: 
    - Raise custom exceptions early. Never fail silently without explicit instruction and clear test coverage.

## Typing & Documentation
- **Type Checking**: Use specific types everywhere. Collate custom types.
- **Comments**: **Do not comment code or tests.** If code isn't understandable, refactor it.
    - **Docblocks** are encouraged.
    - Inline comments are a last resort for rare, unavoidable complexity.

## Testing & Tooling
- **Validation**: All code must be linted, formatted, and type-checked (use automated fixes where available).
- **Service Testing**: Test service layer functionality exhaustively (happy path and all edge cases).
- **Scope**: Do not test out-of-the-box (OOTB) functionality (e.g., built-in model/view methods).
- **Fixtures**: All test fixtures MUST be co-located in a `conftest.py` file. Do not define fixtures within individual test files.
